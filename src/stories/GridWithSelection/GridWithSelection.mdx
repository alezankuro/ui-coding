# GridWithSelection Component

The `GridWithSelection` component displays a grid of cells that allows users to select multiple cells by clicking and dragging to create a selection box.

> **Important:** For the best interactive experience with the selection functionality, view each example in the **Canvas** tab by clicking on the story name in the sidebar. The selection functionality may have limitations in the Docs page due to iframe interactions.

## Features

- Displays a customizable grid with a specified number of rows and columns
- Allows users to select multiple cells by clicking and dragging
- Highlights selected cells with a customizable color
- Responsive design that adapts to container size

## Usage

```tsx
import { GridWithSelection } from './components/GridWithSelection';

function App() {
    return (
        <div style={{ width: '200px' }}>
            <GridWithSelection size={{ rows: 10, cols: 10 }} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## How It Works

The component consists of two main parts:

1. **Grid**: Renders a grid of cells based on the specified number of rows and columns
2. **SelectionBox**: Handles the mouse interactions for creating a selection box

When the user clicks and drags on the grid, a selection box is created. The component then checks which cells intersect with the selection box and highlights them.

## Props

The GridWithSelection component accepts the following props:

- **size**: An object with `rows` and `cols` properties that define the grid dimensions
    - `rows`: Number of rows in the grid (number)
    - `cols`: Number of columns in the grid (number)

## Examples

Below are various examples of the GridWithSelection component with different configurations. For the best interactive experience, view these examples in the Canvas tab.

## Implementation Details

The GridWithSelection component is composed of two main sub-components: Grid and SelectionBox. Here's a detailed breakdown of how they work together:

### Grid Component

The Grid component is responsible for rendering the grid cells and providing methods to interact with them:

- Uses CSS Grid for layout, with the number of columns determined by the `size.cols` prop
- Each cell is rendered as a div with the class `grid-cell`
- Implements a ref-based API using `useImperativeHandle` to expose three key methods:
    - `getCells()`: Returns an array of all grid cell DOM elements
    - `selectCell(cell)`: Adds the `grid-cell--selected` class to a cell
    - `unselectCell(cell)`: Removes the `grid-cell--selected` class from a cell
- The grid cells have a 1:1 aspect ratio using the `aspect-ratio` CSS property
- The selected state of cells is managed through CSS classes rather than React state for performance

```tsx
// Simplified implementation of the Grid component
export function Grid({ ref, size }: GridProps) {
    const gridRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

    useImperativeHandle(
        ref,
        () => ({
            getCells() {
                if (!gridRef.current) return [];
                return Array.from(gridRef.current.querySelectorAll<HTMLElement>('.grid-cell'));
            },
            selectCell(cell: HTMLElement) {
                cell?.classList.add('grid-cell--selected');
            },
            unselectCell(cell: HTMLElement) {
                cell?.classList.remove('grid-cell--selected');
            },
        }),
        [],
    );

    return (
        <div ref={gridRef} className="grid" style={{ '--columns': size.cols } as CSSProperties}>
            {Array.from({ length: size.rows * size.cols }, (_, index) => (
                <div className="grid-cell" key={index}></div>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}
```

### SelectionBox Component

The SelectionBox component handles the user interaction for creating a selection box:

- Renders an absolutely positioned div that serves as the visual selection box
- Uses document-level event listeners to track mouse movements
- Implements a multi-stage interaction process:
    1. On `mousedown`: Initializes the selection box at the cursor position
    2. On `mousemove`: Updates the size and position of the selection box based on cursor movement
    3. On `mouseup`: Hides the selection box and removes event listeners

```tsx
// Simplified implementation of the SelectionBox component
export function SelectionBox({ onSelection }: SelectionBoxProps) {
    const selectionBox = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const onMouseDown = startSelectionHandling(selectionBox.current, onSelection);
        document.addEventListener('mousedown', onMouseDown);
        return () => {
            document.removeEventListener('mousedown', onMouseDown);
        };
    }, [onSelection]);

    return <div ref={selectionBox} className="selection-box"></div>;
}
```

### Selection Handling

The selection handling logic is implemented in utility functions:

- `startSelectionHandling`: Sets up the event listeners and initializes the selection process
- `resettSelectionBoxStyles`: Positions the selection box at the initial click position
- `updateSelectionBoxStyles`: Updates the box dimensions as the user drags
- `hideSelectionBox`: Hides the selection box when the selection is complete
- `isIntersect`: Determines if a cell intersects with the selection box using `getBoundingClientRect()`

The main component, `GridWithSelection`, coordinates these components:

- It holds a ref to the Grid component
- When the selection box changes, it calls `onSelection` which:
    1. Gets all cells from the grid
    2. Checks each cell for intersection with the selection box
    3. Applies or removes the selected state based on intersection

This implementation approach provides a performant selection mechanism that works directly with the DOM, avoiding unnecessary React re-renders during the selection process.
